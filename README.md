# Minecraft-Server-Synchronizer
A small script to synchronize a Minecraft server between you and friends using GitHub. 
Upon running StartServer.cmd the script will pull from your currently checkout branch on GitHub to get the latest saved state of the server and start the Minecraft server up.
When you are done playing type "stop" to stop the Minecraft server and persist the current server state to the currently checked out branch.
